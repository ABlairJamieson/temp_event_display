This directory contains the simple hyperk event display program "hyperk_esd".
You need to have a WCSim output file on which to run the program.

The program needs to know the whereabouts of a ROOT installation and a WCSim
installation. To run it first do

source ../hk-hyperk/Source_At_Start_T2HK.sh

to set all the needed environment variables.
Then:

root -x hyperk_display.C

A ROOT file open dialog box will appear. Navigate to a file containing WCSim
output.

An Eve Window should appear containing two large tabs on the right hand side and
two small ones on the left hand side.

The two left hand side ones are:
---------------------------------

Eve  - the standard Eve controls
Event Control - containing forward and backward arrows for event navigation


The two right hand side ones are:
---------------------------------

Viewer 1 - A 3D event display showing truth tracks and cherenkov hits against a 
          background geometry which contains all phototubes.
Summary  - A brief summary of the truth information found in the event.


Next steps 
---------- 
- Simplified geometry for slower displays e.g. laptops 
- Add an event display for fiTQun.  
- More features can be added upon request. If you make changes to the
code please pass them back to Alex Finch for inclusion in future versions.
